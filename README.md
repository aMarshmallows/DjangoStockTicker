# DjangoStockTicker
Making a stock ticker web app to learn about django! You can see the app by following this link: https://ashdjangostock.herokuapp.com/add_stock.html
This was a fun toy project I did to learn about Django. The app allows you to get information about stock by calling the IEX cloud API and stores the ifnormation in a dashboard.
